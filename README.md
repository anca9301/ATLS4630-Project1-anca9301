## Milestone 1: Proposal

### Project Description
A fun website about narwhals and containing narwhal facts.

### How a JavaScript library will enhance user experience

The website use animations to create a playful atmosphere and create an animated journey. Since the purpose of this website is to inform people about narwhals and create a fun experience, I plan on using anime.js (and potentially aos.js) to add fun animations. If there's time, I want to include interactive animations so that users to hover over/click certain spots and prompt something.  

The plan is that people will be more drawn towards these and retain more information. I was inspired by Species In Pieces (http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#) for the concept.

### Responsive Website Goals
When the length of the screen is shorter than its height, I plan on rearranging to screen so that the facts will pop-up on the top and bottom with the middle empty.

### Project Goals
#### Prototyping/Proof Of Concept
- website with page transitions and pop-up boxes
- website also includes some/most of the facts filled in

#### Minimum Viable Product
- a website that uses animation to transition between the pages
- a navigation bar at the bottom of the website
- flowing water & background animations
- create an animation of a swimming narwhal

#### Stretch Goals
- add additional interactive animations

## Milestone 2: Check-In
### Progress Report
I have completed the code for a general animation of a wave and the swimming narwhal motion. I also have code for the water surface rising as the narwhal dives but have not connected the animation yet.

After giving the swimming concept more thought, I'll probably have to use a simple gif to animate the movement of the narwhal. The movement animation requires too many parts, and additional animation on top of too much could mess up all my progress.

Besides animation, I've made progress on the layout of the website. Since I want to use a horizontal scroll, I've come across a lot of trouble while positioning and overlapping elements.

With my current progress, I'll have to rethink how the diving animation will work. I'll probably have to connect it to a button instead of having it as an automatic action when you reach a certain point.

I've decided that animating textbox popups is not necessary because it won't add much and the animate on scroll library uses css? for the code. It's now a stretch goal in case I finish everything else early.

I've also gathered some facts about narwhals but haven't put them on the website yet. I plan on adding them and styling the page after I figure out the website code.

Overrall, I have made decent progress. Looking over my milestone 1 goals, they still seem reasonable. However, I was probably confused about the prototyping/proof of concept because I seem to have completed more of the minimum viable product goals.
