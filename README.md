### How a JavaScript library will enhance user experience

The website use animations to create a playful atmosphere and create an animated journey. Since the purpose of this website is to inform people about narwhals and create a fun experience, I plan on using anime.js (and potentially aos.js) to add fun animations. If there's time, I want to include interactive animations so that users to hover over/click certain spots and prompt something.  

The plan is that people will be more drawn towards these and retain more information. I was inspired by Species In Pieces (http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#) for the concept.

### Responsive Website Goals
When the length of the screen is shorter than its height, I plan on rearranging to screen so that the facts will pop-up on the top and bottom with the middle empty.

### Project Goals
#### Prototyping/Proof Of Concept
- website with page transitions and pop-up boxes
- website also includes some/most of the facts filled in

#### Minimum Viable Product
- a website that uses animation to transition between the pages
- a navigation bar at the bottom of the website
- flowing water & background animations
- create an animation of a swimming narwhal

#### Stretch Goals
- add additional interactive animations
